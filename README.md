# Mikerochip's Unity Web Socket

Easy-to-use, flexible WebSocket client as a simple MonoBehaviour.

* Easy-to-use, configurable `WebSocketConnection` MonoBehaviour
* URL is the only required config, sane defaults otherwise
* Does not force you to use `async/await` or Coroutines
* Works with WebGL using bundled JavaScript lib `WebSocket.jslib`
* Works on other platforms using built-in `System.Net.WebSockets`
* Just Works - public API prevents bad internal states

# Minimum Install Requirements

Unity 2019.1 with .NET 4.x Runtime or higher
